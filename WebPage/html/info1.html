        <p>In this seminar, students will learn how to
        empirically prove the effects of educational
        politics  in Japan or at world by using basic
        theory or methods of economics.</p>

        <p>Every semester, we will hold “Mini Conference”
        where students will present their research
        results.</p>

        <p>We will conduct reading and discussion of the
        specified papers, learning how to use SPSS,
        STATA, R, Python, etc., as well as regular training
        and quizzes to improve English skills from the
        bottom up.</p>

        <p>Participants in the “Mini Conference” and
        submitting their research plan will be notified of
        the interview schedule.
        We put emphasis on intensive education with a
        small number of students, therefore maximum
        number of students will be around 15.
        The competitive ratio is about 3 times. See the
        syllabus for more details.</p>

        <p>In this seminar, we look at specific measures
          related to how effective platforms are designed
          in the context of community innovation.
          The platform is defined as, “tools and mechanisms
          that serve as the basis for communication, which
          promotes cooperation when various constituents
          are cooperating.” If designs are carried out
          effectively, platforms have the potential to form
          connections between diverse constituents such as
          people and groups and bring about emergence based
          on interactions.
          Action Research and Project Based Learning are
          partially incorporated in order to create
          practical wisdom.</p>

            <p>In this seminar, students study ways of natural and
              creative living and how to shift our society to be more
              natural and creative.</p>
            <p>So far, Iba Kenkyukai has created various pattern languages,
              focusing mainly on a trilogy called "Learning Pattern"
              for creative learning, "Presentation Pattern" for
              stimulating creative presentation, and "Collaboration
              Pattern" for creative collaboration. We have positioned
              such pattern languages in "human behavior" as "Pattern
              Language 3.0" and are in the process of pioneering the study.</p>
            <p>This year, we are creating a pattern language in a
              completely new area such as disaster prevention, education,
              organizational change, global way of life, revitalizing
              Japanese methods, etc. We also work to help those who
              create their own pattern language.</p>

            <p>In recent years, we have not only read in detail textbooks
              ealing with the social choice theory and the application of
              game theory to public choice, but also examined the decision
              analysis beyond "rational choice", for example, the Gilboa's
              decision theory. This year we will read an intermediate textbook
              of game theory. In this semester, we will continue to read an
              intermediate textbook on game theory.</p>
            <p>I hope to encourage competition among the participants of

              In this seminar students are requested to pick up your own topic and
              make presentations. It also means students need to devote their time
              and other resources to prepare for their researches outside usual
              class time. Any topics on China or Japan-China relations are welcomed.
              At the begging of a semester and end of a semester we have a research
              camp outside SFC. Students make their final presentations and submit
              their papers.</p>

              Based on the students' research interest, we design and implement
              research projects. Up to now, the following projects were implemented：
              Marketing Communication, Science and Technology Communication.</p>

              studies and academic disciplines. To give an example, in the case

              be needed study whole problems such as history, political problems,
              economics, religion, ethnic problem, social problems, geopolitical
              problems and so on, in the area, because the reasons of conflicts
              are really complicated. In addition, trying to generalize by comparing
              with other cases or regions, applying some disciplines, making general
              theories and so on would be also important. I would like to stress not to
              complete regional research by regional research alone, but make it
              available in a wider academic context, enable dialogue with experts
              from other regions and researchers of other disciplines, and make
              academic contributions.</p>
            <p>For this aim, we will study general theories or discussions by reading
              books, and hear and discuss about each students’ research. All students
              must participate to the reading, make presentation and write term paper
              or graduate thesis on individual research.</p>
