      <p>We promote basic studies about ‘neural information science’ by measuring
        and analyzing neural information and apply the findings to generalization
        of brain information, VR/AR, media, health, and so on. Recent advances in
        non-invasive brain measurement techniques enable us to see the human brain
        objectively. We study how to clarify the brain mechanism using EEG
        (electroencephalography), tES (transcranial electrical stimulation),
        MEG (magnetoencephalography), and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging),
        and promote research to achieve not only good graduation projects but also
        conference presentations and journal publications.</p>
      <p>In the first half of the class, we hold ‘journal clubs’ or ‘progress reports’.
        In the second half, I explain how to measure and analyze neural information
        (‘seminar / workshop’) in addition to the journal club and the progress report.
        A higher priority will be given to the seminar/workshop in this semester.
        In research activity, we mainly use the 64-channel whole-head EEG system,
        the tES system, the 32-channel wireless EEG system, and the 16-channel simple
        EEG system (OpenBCI) to aquire and to analyze neural information. We also
        perform simultaneous measurement with head mounted display and
        behavioral/biophysical measurement, and make hardware/software as needed.
        Anyone who meets the provided conditions can be involved in a research project
        using MEG and MRI installed in the other institution.</p>

      <p>Instead of learning to learn, we aim to become a place where you learn to think,
        learn in practice, and acquire highly versatile skills. We will evolve dynamically
        through the trial and error of the management of this workshop itself. The following
        is a provisional plan at the present stage. Firstly, each person has some theme according
        to the fundamental formula of value design society (Future = Dream / Issue × Technology × Design),
        each person has their own theme, and autonomously promote from assignment setting to execution.
        At each stage of assignment setting, analysis design, extraction of meaning
        and consolidation, guidance on issue driven and data driven problem solving
        is conducted separately and throughout, and mutual learning is done.
        (Promotion direction is provisional)</p>
      <p>Promoted by individuals or several group work depending on the size of the
        theme. Depending on the theme, there may be one that ends in about a month,
        while others may last for about a year. (Please let me know what you really
        want to do at the stage of entry to this research group.)</p>

      <p>Our brain and body are always interacting each other by sending information
        named "neural signals", and being essentials for our movements and sensations.
        In this seminar, by considering the brain and body as a system, we are trying
        to learn the control and learning mechanisms of our bodily movements and to
        understand the secrets and essentials of humans. The PI is basically an
        electro-physiologist, measuring EEG and EMG and/or stimulating the brain
        and nerve using evoked-EMG and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques.
        However, we don't get research ideas from methodologies. Depending on your

      <p>Designing Energy for Better Society We engage to deliver the unique design
        solution with various researches to our society/environment/planet earth.
        Energy is one of the most important elements for our modernized society.
        But at the same time, energy causes many problems, such as a conflict
        between some countries for energy resources, disparity in wealth, monopolized
        energy market, danger in disastrous accident, politic background, technical
        limitation, affordability and profitability etc. “Can Design -that always
        provides some kind of positive lights in society- create brighter Energy
        Future? “ Our Energy Solution would cover urban scale, space/architecture
        to human scale device, passive and active, minimizing the consumption of
        energy or generate more of it actively. Furthermore, the energy situations
        are very different between developed and developing countries, and high-tech
        energy and versatility low-tech energy, social solution and entertainment
        solution – e.g. Apps-. There are still many areas that needed to be solved
        by talented young designers in this field. We are aiming to create open-minded,
        wisely-realistic and positive-driven energy design project together.</p>

      <p>This kenkyukai focuses on the development of smart city and region by data-driven
        approach. We use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other advanced
        technologies to monitor, analyze, and model environmental issues for sustainable
        development in urban and regions. What you can learn at this kenkyukai is Statistics,
        Geospatial data processing, Fieldwork, Quantitative and Qualitative Survey,
        Logical thinking, Human Geography, Physical Geography. The geographic information
        system (GIS) lets us visualize, question, analyze and interpret data to
        understand relationships, patterns and trends. GIS has been used in a wide
        range of fields such as medical, commercial, disaster prevention, agriculture,
        security, tourism and urban development. It is said that more than 70% of
        the information is related to GIS. Thus, applying GIS studies to your research
        will increase the persuasiveness of your reseach dramatically.</p>

      <p>In this seminar (kenkyu-kai), we attempt to explore the notions of "place"
        and "placemaking" from the standpoint of media and communication studies.
        When we reflect upon the nature of our social relationships, being with
        someone or being on-site (at the time of the event) is becoming more and
        more important. It points to the idea of "design of sharing," and that is
        realized through raising our consciousness about our problems at hand. Our
        research projects aim to promote a sense of belonging to the community, and
        the nature of human relationships therein, through a series of field research
        and qualitative analyses. I do welcome foreign students to join my kenkyu-kai,
        but classes and field trips will be operated mainly in Japanese. Thus we may
        need to find ways to cope with various communication issues, and I am eager
        to do so.</p>

      <p>From the viewpoint of the sociality, the perception and context capturing
        function possessed by robots themselves is an important factor in determining
        behaviors of robots in human interactions. We are focusing attention on the
        emotional recognition of the communication partner, that is, the acquisition
        mechanism of human’s emotional changes, which is indispensable for realizing
        “social and emotional interaction”, and have been exemplifying its principles,
        implementation methods, and application examples. We have exemplified

      <p>In this seminar, students will discuss and explore the process of second
        language learning and teaching through studying textbooks and research
        articles. Students will learn how to conduct research such as how to develop
        research themes and research questions, how to design research, and data
        analysis, as well as how to write a research paper. Students will work on
        their individual studies, giving each other feedback in weekly discussions.
        This lab has about 25 students including graduate students,and most of them
        have had experience living or studying abroad and are proficient speakers
        of English.</p>
      <p>Discussions will be conducted in both English and Japanese, and I am
        hopeful that both Japanese and international students can improve English
        and Japanese proficiency respectively by being in this seminar.</p>
